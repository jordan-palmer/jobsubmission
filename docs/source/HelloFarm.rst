Hello Farm?
===========

We have developed a simple python script named **HelloFarm.py** which writes "Hello Farm" to a .txt file. We highly recommend beginners to attempt to run this code to understand how the python functions work. 

1. Change the variables at the top of the file.

2. Go to the command line and do:

.. code-block:: console

   python HelloFarm.py

Now, a directory with the same name as your **jobname** within your working directory, **workdir**. Inside this directory, a file named **HelloFarm.txt**, i.e the same name as the **myfile** parameter, should have been created. Check inside this file for the text **"Hello Farm"**. If this file is empty or doesn't exist something has gone wrong. The first step when debugging is verifying that the variables are instantiated in the same way as in the example.
